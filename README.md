A command line tool to statically analyse your page in order to generate the most optimal web font subsets, then inject them into your page.

Speed up your time to first meaningful paint by reducing the web font payload and critical path to the font files.

Subfont will:

- Automatically figure out what characters are used from each font
- Warn you about usage of characters that don't exist as glyphs in your webfonts
- Create an exact subset of used characters of each font
- Generate web fonts in both `woff2` and `woff` formats
- Add preload hints for the subsets to reduce time to first meaningful paint
- Add JS font loading for browsers without preload support
- Give the subsetted fonts new names and prepend them in front of the original fonts in your `font-family` definitions (enables missing glyph fallback)
- Async load your original `@font-face` declaring CSS at the bottom of your page, moving it off the critical path

Currently supported font services:

- Google fonts
- Local fonts (with [fonttools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools))

**If you know of font services with liberal font usage licenses, open an issue and we'll add support for them**

## Installation

Get the basic CLI tool, which supports subsetting Google Fonts and optimizing all local fonts with preloading instructions:

```
npm install -g subfont
```

## Recommended usage

Run subfont on the files you are ready to deploy to a static file hosting service. If these are build artifacts from another build system, and not the original files, run `subfont path/to/artifacts/index.html -i` to have `subfont` clobber the dist files in their original location.

If you want to run directly against your raw original files, it is recommended to create a recursive copy of your files which you run `subfont` on. This keeps your original authoring abstraction unchanged.

## Including additional characters in the subsets

If you have a use case where the automatic tracing doesn't find all the characters you need, you can tell subfont to include specific characters in the subsets by adding a custom `-subfont-text` property to the respective `@font-face` declarations.

Example where all numerical digits are added to the bold italic Roboto variant:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: Roboto;
  font-style: italic;
  font-weight: 700;
  src: url(roboto.woff) format('woff');
  -subfont-text: '0123456789';
}
```

An easier, but less fine-grained option is to use the `--text` switch to include a set of characters in all created subsets.

## Other usages

You can have subfont output a copy of your input files to a new directory. This uses [Assetgraph](https://github.com/assetgraph/assetgraph) to trace a dependency graph of your website and writes it to your specified output directory. Be aware of any errors or warnings that might indicate Assetgraph having problems with your code, and be sure to double check that the expected files are in the output directory. Run `subfont path/to/index.html -o path/to/outputDir`.

You can also have subfont scrape a website directly using http and write the output to local disk. This use is likely to fail in a number of ways and should mostly considered a demo feature if you just want to give the tool a quick go to see what it will do to your page. Run `subfont https://yourpage.me -o path/to/outputDir`.
